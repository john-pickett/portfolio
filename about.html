<h2 class="text-center">Full-Stack Web Development + Marketing Expertise</h2>

<p>I'm in love with the creative aspect of coding. Getting to take a project from a simple idea all the way to a full-featured application is incredible. I usually work in Node and Mongo for the back end, and React or Vue for the front end.</p>

<h3>My Background</h3>

<p>My first job after college was in the financial industry, where I began learning about sales and marketing by selling insurance and investment products. 5 years later, I started my own business - an
online cooking school for people who eat a gluten free diet.</p>

<p>I bootstrapped the cooking school from the ground up, and had a blast running it. In 2015, after 8 years, I decided I was ready for a new challenge. I began doing freelance marketing work while also focusing on my real passon, learning more about coding.</p>

<p>I've loved programming ever since taking a class on BASIC in 7th grade, and getting to see my ideas come to life in code is amazing.</p>

<h3>Free Time</h3>

<p>When I'm not coding, I like to play Ultimate Frisbee, run, take photos with my Canon T4, and play video games. (My current favorite game is Hearthstone.)</p>
