<h1>Stats Hound: Easily Monitor Your Website Traffic</h1>
<img src="/images/stats-hound.jpg" class="port-img">

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Stats Hound was built in Rails, using PostgreSQL for the database and Devise for user authentication.
  It allows users to sign up for a free account, add the websites they want to track to their profile, and
  get the tracking code for each website.</p>

<p>Once they've added the code to their website, Stats Hound begins tracking the events that are generated
  by their traffic, logging each event to the database. The user can then log in to Stats Hound and see the
  events in their dashboard.</p>

<h3>Build and Design</h3>

<p>The first aspect of Stats Hound that I started building was the user model. I wanted my users to be
  able to easily create an account, add as many websites as they wanted, and of course, keep their stats and
  traffic numbers private.</p>

<p>I accomplished this with help from the fantastic Devise gem, which facilitates easy account creation,
  email verification, and password protection for each user. I also wrote the code for the navbar to show a
  link to Sign Up or Login if the current user is not logged in, and if they are, the navbar greets them and
  gives them easy access to their registered websites.</p>

<h3>User Dashboard</h3>

<img src="/images/sh-dashboard.jpg" class="port-img">

<p>I wanted the user dashboard to give plenty of information without overloading the user with too many numbers
  or stats. So I created the "at-a-glance" section at the top of the dashboard, giving the user the stats from
  the last 30 days. A user can check this in a few seconds and quickly gauge how their website is performing.</p>

<p>Below the quick-glance stats, I used Chartkick to visually represent the different events for the user's website.
  There is a chart for page views, new users, sales, and messages sent, and the user can select to see the stats
  from the last 30, 60, and 90 days.</p>

<h3>Tracking Code and the API</h3>

<p>The heart and soul of Stats Hound is the tracking code that each user puts on their website.</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var statshound = {};

statshound.report = function(eventName)
  { var event = {event: { name: eventName }};
  var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open("POST", "https://stats-hound-97714.herokuapp.com/api/events", true);
  request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  request.send(JSON.stringify(event)); }

statshound.report("pageview");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When loaded on the user's website, this code creates a new javascript object named statshound, then
  creates an HttpRequest that pings the API in Stats Hound, which in turn creates a new event, under that
  application's ID, with the name specified in the last line of code.</p>

<p>Using this code allows users to specify the event that they want registered on each page. For instance, changing
  "pageview" to "sale", and adding the code to the "Succesful Sale" page will log a sale. Users can use this in a
  similar fashion to track new registrations on their site and new messages sent in by their visitors.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Stats Hound was definitely a lot of fun to make. Getting the API to work correctly was a bit tricky,
  but it's super cool putting the tracking code on another website, and watching the logs in Stats Hound
  as events come in and get created in real time.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I'd love to let Stats Hound track unique visitors to my users' websites, as well as track
  where each visitor is coming from - whether it's social media, Google, direct traffic, or some other source.</p>
