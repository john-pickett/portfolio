        <h1>Understanding Javascript Loops: For, While, and Do While</h1>

        <p>Loops are a very efficient method in Javascript for running a command over and over on a set of data.
          But there are a few different types of loops, and when you're new to Javascript it can be difficult to
          keep them straight. In this article, we'll be taking an in-depth look at three different Javascript
          loops: the <strong>for loop</strong>, the <strong>while loop</strong>, and the <strong>do while loop</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Data Set and Our Problem</h2>

        <p>To show how loops can help us solve problems efficiently in Javascript, let's say that an elementary school
        teacher has asked us to help her create a seating chart for her students. Miss Alice has 26 students, and she
        wants a random seating chart for her classroom.</p>

        <p>Let's create an array of her students:</p>

        <p class="code"> var students = ["Ava", "Barry", "Charlie", "David", "Elizabeth", "Frank", "Grant", "Holly", "Ian",
          "Jimmy", "Keri", "Lucy", "Mindy", "Nancy", "Ophelia", "Peter", "Quentin", "Russell", "Sally", "Theresa",
          "Umberto", "Veronica", "Walter", "Xavier", "Yvette", "Zeke"];</p>

        <h2>Starting Off Easy With The For Loop</h2>

        <p>Now that we have the students in a data set that we can use, let's start off easy by printing out
        a list of Miss Alice's students for her. We'll do it using a for loop.</p>

        <p class="code">for (var i = 0; i < students.length; i ++){<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; console.log(students[i]);<br>
        }</p>

        <p>If we were to run this code, we would get the following list:</p>

        <p class="code">Ava
          Barry
          Charlie
          David
          Elizabeth
          Frank
          Grant
          Holly
          Ian
          Jimmy
          Keri
          Lucy
          Mindy
          Nancy
          Ophelia
          Peter
          Quentin
          Russell
          Sally
          Theresa
          Umberto
          Veronica
          Walter
          Xavier
          Yvette
          Zeke</p>

        <p>Let's break down what happened with the for loop. The first part of the loop <span class="code-inline">
          for (var i = 0;)</span> begins the loop, creates a variable named <span class="code-inline">i</span> and
          sets it equal to <span class="code-inline">0</span>. It's common to use <span class="code-inline">i</span> as your variable and set it equal to <span class="code-inline">0</span>,
          but it's important to know that you can choose any name for your variable and set it equal to any number (as we'll soon see!).</p>

        <p>All that <span class="code-inline">i</span> is doing here is acting as a counter. The second part of the loop
          <span class="code-inline">i < students.length; i ++</span> tells the for loop how long to run. <span class="code-inline">i ++</span>
          means "add 1 to <span class="code-inline">i</span> each time you loop", and <span class="code-inline">i < students.length</span>
          means run as long as <span class="code-inline">i</span> is less than the length of the students array.</p>

        <p>The first time the for loop runs, the loop creates the variable <span class="code-inline">i</span>, sets it
          equal to <span class="code-inline">0</span>, checks to make sure it satisfies the second part of the statement
          <span class="code-inline"> i < students.length</span>, adds 1 to <span class="code-inline">i</span>, and then
          finally executes the code in your loop. (In this example, that's the <span class="code-inline">console.log</span> statement.)
          It continues that pattern until <span class="code-inline">i</span> does not satisfy the criteria in the second part
          the statement, at which point the loop stops.</p>


        <h2>Now, About That Seating Chart</h2>

        <p>So far all we've done for Miss Alice is print out a list of her students. Which, presumably, she
        already had. So let's get to work on the random seating chart.</p>

        <p>Here's some code, that based on what we've learned so far, should make a random seating chart:</p>

        <p class="code">var students = ["Ava", "Barry", "Charlie", "David", "Elizabeth", "Frank", "Grant", "Holly", "Ian",
          "Jimmy", "Keri", "Lucy", "Mindy", "Nancy", "Ophelia", "Peter", "Quentin", "Russell", "Sally", "Theresa", "Umberto",
          "Veronica", "Walter", "Xavier", "Yvette", "Zeke"];<br><br>

          var seatingChart = [];<br><br>

          for (var i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * students.length);<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp seatingChart.push(students.splice(random, 1));<br>
          }

          console.log(seatingChart);</p>

        <p>What I've done in this code is create a new, empty array called <span class="code-inline">seatingChart</span>
          that will eventually hold our random list. Then, in the for loop, I have a variable <span class="code-inline">random</span>
          which is going to be assigned a random number between 0 and the current length of the students array. (Because <span class="code-inline">random</span>
          is inside the for loop, it will be assigned a new random value each time the loop runs.)</p>

        <p>Next I'm going to find the student at the <span class="code-inline">random</span> position in the students array,
        remove it from <span class="code-inline">students</span> and add it to <span class="code-inline">seatingChart</span>.
        (If you aren't familiar with <span class="code-inline">Math.floor()</span>, <span class="code-inline">Math.random()</span>,
        <span class="code-inline">.push()</span>, or <span class="code-inline">.splice()</span>, that's ok. It's enough for now
        to know what the for loop is supposed to do.)</p>

        <p>When we run this code, we should get a list of all 26 students in a random order. But what we actually get is something like this: </p>

        <p class="code">[ 'Peter',
          'David',
          'Nancy',
          'Walter',
          'Yvette',
          'Elizabeth',
          'Zeke',
          'Russell',
          'Grant',
          'Sally',
          'Barry',
          'Lucy',
          'Ophelia' ]</p>

        <p>That's only 13 students. What happened?</p>

        <p>The problem lies in how we defined our for loop. We set it to run as long as <span class="code-inline">i < students.length</span>,
          and at the same time, we're removing the student's name from <span class="code-inline">students</span> (so that they don't get
          assigned to the <span class="code-inline">seatingChart</span> twice). So <span class="code-inline">i</span> is counting up
          at the same time that <span class="code-inline">students.length</span> is getting smaller. Eventually,
        they meet in the middle, at 13, and the for loop stops.</p>

        <p>So, how can we solve this problem and get Miss Alice her seating chart? There are a couple of solutions.</p>

        <p>The first thing that we could do is simply create the for loop like this:</p>

        <p class="code">for (var i = 0; i < 26; i++) {<br>
          &nbsp&nbsp var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * students.length);<br>
          &nbsp&nbsp seatingChart.push(students.splice(random, 1));<br>
        }</p>

        <p>Using <span class="code-inline">i < 26</span> ensures that our loop will run the correct number of times
          and assign every student to the <span class="code-inline">seatingChart</span>. However, that's not a very elegant solution.
          What if we didn't know the exact number of students in the class? A better option would be this:</p>

        <p class="code">for (var i = students.length; i > 0; i--) {<br>
          &nbsp&nbsp var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * students.length);<br>
          &nbsp&nbsp seatingChart.push(students.splice(random, 1));<br>
        }</p></p>

        <p>Here we are assigning <span class="code-inline">i</span> the value of <span class="code-inline">students.length</span>,
          then subtracting 1 each loop, and telling it to run as long as <span class="code-inline">i > 0</span>. Using this
          solution ensures that the loop will select every student from the original array no matter how many students there are.</p>

        <h2>Using A While Loop</h2>

        <p>That last solution we discussed is actually very similar to the while loop. Here's how the code would
          look in a while loop:</p>

        <p class="code">var students = ["Ava", "Barry", "Charlie", "David", "Elizabeth", "Frank", "Grant", "Holly", "Ian",
          "Jimmy", "Keri", "Lucy", "Mindy", "Nancy", "Ophelia", "Peter", "Quentin", "Russell", "Sally", "Theresa",
          "Umberto", "Veronica", "Walter", "Xavier", "Yvette", "Zeke"];<br><br>

          var i = students.length;<br><br>
          while (i > 0) {<br>
            &nbsp&nbspvar random = Math.floor(Math.random() * students.length);<br>
            &nbsp&nbspseatingChart.push(students.splice(random, 1)[0]);<br>
            &nbsp&nbspi --;<br>
          }
        </p>

        <p>The syntax of a while loop is a little bit different, but you can still see what's happening.
          We're setting <span class="code-inline">i = students.length</span> (outside of the loop this time), and
          then removing a student randomly from the array. Be sure to put in the line of code that increments
          or decrements <span class="code-inline">i</span>, or else your loop will run forever! (and crash your browser.)</p>

        <p>A while loop runs as long as the statement in the parentheses is true. We set <span class="code-inline">i = students.length</span>
          and then decrement it by one each loop, so the loop will run as long as <span class="code-inline">i > 0</span>. Once <span class="code-inline">i</span>
          hits 0, the loop stops.</p>

        <p>In case you're curious, if the statement in the while loop is false, the loop will never run.</p>

        <h2>Finally, A Random Seating Chart</h2>

        <p>At long last, we have a random seating chart for Miss Alice. We can do it using either the while loop
          or the last for loop solution that we talked about. If you'd like to play around with these loops and data,
          try this.</p>

        <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/savamixoqa/embed?js,console,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.41.5"></script>


        <h2>What About The Do-While Loop?</h2>

        <p>We don't need to use a do-while loop to make the seating chart, but here's an example of one
          for the sake of completeness. A do-while loop is very similar to a while loop, but it guarantees
          that your code will run at least one time.</p>

        <p class="code">var i = 0;<br>
            <br>
          do {<br>
            &nbsp&nbspconsole.log(i);<br>
            &nbsp&nbspi++;<br>
          }<br>
          while (i < 10);
        </p>

        <p>This will log <span class="code-inline">i</span> to the console 10 times, but if we changed the code
          to say <span class="code-inline">while (i > 10);</span> thus making it a false statement, the code would still run one time.</p>
