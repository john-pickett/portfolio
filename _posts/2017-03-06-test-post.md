title: "Understanding Javascript Loops: For, While, and Do-While"

  <p>Loops are a very efficient method in Javascript for running a command over and over on a set of data.
    But there are a few different types of loops, and when you're new to Javascript it can be difficult to
    keep them straight. In this article, we'll be taking an in-depth look at three different Javascript
    loops: the <strong>for loop</strong>, the <strong>while loop</strong>, and the <strong>do while loop</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Data Set and Our Problem</h2>

  <p>To show how loops can help us solve problems efficiently in Javascript, let's say that an elementary school
  teacher has asked us to help her create a seating chart for her students. Miss Alice has 26 students, and she
  wants a random seating chart for her classroom.</p>

  <p>Let's create an array of her students:</p>

  <p class="code"> var students = ["Ava", "Barry", "Charlie", "David", "Elizabeth", "Frank", "Grant", "Holly", "Ian",
    "Jimmy", "Keri", "Lucy", "Mindy", "Nancy", "Ophelia", "Peter", "Quentin", "Russell", "Sally", "Theresa",
    "Umberto", "Veronica", "Walter", "Xavier", "Yvette", "Zeke"];</p>

  <h2>Starting Off Easy With The For Loop</h2>

  <p>Now that we have the students in a data set that we can use, let's start off easy by printing out
  a list of Miss Alice's students for her. We'll do it using a for loop.</p>
